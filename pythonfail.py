""" Lab 2.1 Python Development Exercises
You need to create two functions to substitute str() and int(). A function called int_to_str() that converts integers
into strings and a function called str_to_int() that converts strings into integers.

Examples:
int_to_str(4) ➞ "4"
str_to_int("4") ➞ 4
int_to_str(29348) ➞ "29348"
